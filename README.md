## 📜 Research Context

- This compiler was designed in line with academic needs:

- Lexical & syntax analysis → ensures correctness of code

- Fraud detection → identifies direct hardcoded outputs and invalid tokens

- Time complexity analysis → evaluates performance of algorithms

- Summarization → provides structured feedback to both students & teachers
