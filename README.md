# 📘 Java Compiler with AST Visualization and Fraud Detection  

This project presents a **Java compiler web application** designed to assist teachers in testing students’ Java programs and help students practice coding interactively. It provides **lexical analysis, syntax analysis, time complexity estimation, fraud detection, and AST visualization** through a clean HTML/Flask interface.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🖊️ Online editor for typing Java code  
- 🔍 Lexical & syntax analysis with error reporting  
- ⏱️ Time complexity estimation  
- 🛡️ Fraud detection (detects direct answer-printing and invalid tokens)  
- 🌳 AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) visualization using Graphviz  
- 📊 Performance profiling of student programs  
- 🎨 User-friendly web interface for both teachers and students  

---

## 🎯 Objective
- **For Educators** → Faster evaluation of students’ assignments with analysis, fraud detection, and code correctness metrics  
- **For Students** → Interactive platform to practice Java coding, analyze logic, and learn debugging  

---

## 🌐 Deployment

- **You can deploy on**
- → Heroku (via Procfile)
- → Render / Railway
- → Docker (optional Dockerfile setup)

## 📜 Research Context

- This compiler was designed in line with academic needs:

- Lexical & syntax analysis → ensures correctness of code

- Fraud detection → identifies direct hardcoded outputs and invalid tokens

- Time complexity analysis → evaluates performance of algorithms

- Summarization → provides structured feedback to both students & teachers
